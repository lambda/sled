[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spacejam/sled.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spacejam/sled)

A pre-alpha modern embedded database.

```rust
extern crate sled;

use sled::{ConfigBuilder, Tree};

let config = ConfigBuilder::new()
  .path(path)
  .build();

let tree = Tree::start(config);

// set and get
tree.set(k, v1);
assert_eq!(tree.get(&k), Some(v1));

// compare and swap
tree.cas(k, Some(v1), Some(v2));

// scan forward
let mut iter = tree.scan(k);
assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((k, v2)));
assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);

// deletion
tree.del(&k);
```

# features

* ordered map API
* fully atomic single-key operations, supports CAS
* [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) compression (use the zstd build feature)
* cpu-scalable lock-free implementation
* SSD-optimized log-structured storage

# goals

1. don't make the user think. the interface should be obvious.
1. don't surprise users with performance traps.
1. don't wake up operators. bring reliability techniques from academia into real-world practice.
1. don't use so much electricity. our data structures should play to modern hardware's strengths.

# plans

* beat [LSM trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree)
  for reads and [traditional B+ trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree) for writes
* MVCC, transactions, merge operators and snapshots provided via a higher-level `Db` versioned-key interface
* custom merge operators a la RocksDB
* form the iron core of a [linearizable store](https://github.com/spacejam/rasputin) and a [flexible location-agnostic store](https://github.com/spacejam/icefall)
* SQLite, MySQL, Postgres back-end plugin support
* forward-compatible binary format
* dynamic learned/probabilistic index support
* bindings for other languages

# warnings

* quite young, should be considered unstable for the time being
* the C API is likely to change rapidly
* the on-disk format is going to change in non-forward compatible ways
  before the `1.0.0` release! after that, we will always support
  forward migrations.
* has not yet received much attention for performance tuning,
  it has an extremely high theoretical performance but there
  is a bit of tuning to get there. currently only around 200k
  operations per second with mixed workloads, and 7 million/s
  for read-only workloads on tiny keys. this will be improving 
  dramatically soon!

# architecture

lock-free tree on a lock-free pagecache on a lock-free log. the pagecache scatters
partial page fragments across the log, rather than rewriting entire pages at a time
as B+ trees for spinning disks historically have. on page reads, we concurrently
scatter-gather reads across the log to materialize the page from its fragments.
